# Introduction

Please read the LICENCE.

This repository is designed for reuse from problem set to problem set for CS 1538, taught by Mike Lipschultz during the Spring 2016 semester at the University of Pittsburgh.
The author is Robbie McKinstry.

I anticipate that the design will be tweaked as I learn more about pattern in simulation design. I'm anticipating a run loop, as well as a settings file, emerging.
